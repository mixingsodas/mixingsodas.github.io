This repository contains an initial readme file with the phrase "hello world", a twine file titled "index.html" that contains my portion of the final twine narrative as well as variables for my endings and for the 'getting ready' introduction sequence, and a twine story (miniassignment.html) with multimedia, variables, conditionals, and modified text styles.
